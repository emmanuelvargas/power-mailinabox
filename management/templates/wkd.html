<h2>WKD Management</h2>

<p>WKD (<b>W</b>eb <b>K</b>ey <b>D</b>irectory) is an experimental feature that allows
	users to authoratively publish their public PGP keys on the web, via HTTPS.</p>
<p>Unlike other solutions like public keyservers, WKD has the advantage that the owner
	of the domain has some degree of control over what keys are published and as such there
	is more certainity that the key actually belongs to it's owner.</p>
<p>As of this version, there is no support for WKS - This may or may not change in the future.</p>

<h3>Hosting somewhere else</h3>
<a>
	If you have a separate server to host WKD, you can still use it instead of this box on a per-domain basis.
	<br>
	This box uses the Advanced Method to serve the keys. For example, to host your <code>@some.example.com</code> keys,
	you can add a A, AAAA or CNAME record for <code>openpgpkey.some.example.com</code>. It will override the box's records.
	<br><br>
	There's not a way to "disable" WKD at the moment - but if you don't want to publish keys, or if you want to use the
	Direct method somewhere else, you can always set the records to an unreachable destination
	(for example, an A record to <code>0.0.0.0</code>)
</a>

<h3>Emails hosted by this box</h3>
<a>
	This box can serve keys to any email address hosted by this box, be it an user or an alias,
	granted that the key has one or more user id's with matching emails.
	<br>
	You can add keys on the PGP Keyring Management menu.
